<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Sanajana Singh. I like trying out new things as that challenges my intellectual and creative capacity. I really love my freedom that explains why I left my job and decided to pursue freelancing.</p>

<p>Living alone and trying to manage both your life and work and mental health can get hectic, but I always try to be there for myself and my friends. I love helping people by trying to give tyhem advice and suggestions on emotional and mental health./p>

<p>Currently I am learning after effects and Web development as I feel like my brain is not getting challenged enough by the career obstacles infront of it. I love proving people wrong and I like being corrected too. I am always open to healthy debates and challenging arguments.</p>
